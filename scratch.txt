f it's lunch, http://evenstevens.com/ might be a good place. I ate there once and thought it was pretty good.

I like provisions but thats maybe a little higher than you're shooting for

also probably on the high side is copper onion… like that place

[12:46]  
R&R BBQ is solid, maybe on the cheaper side

if you like middle eastern, I really like Mazza… that’s prob right around the ~$20 per plate

Mike's recommendations are solid, here are a couple of other ideas..

- Finca (http://www.fincaslc.com/) it is small plate/tapas.  So, you can get lots of different things.  It is fun to be able try different things and share.

- Avenues Proper (http://www.avenuesproper.com/menu/dinner/) is kind of fun, but it is a bit of a gastro pub feel.  I think they make their own beer.  Think Squatters, Red Rock or Wasatch, but smaller and more intimate.  Foods pretty good, but not sure if that would up your mom's alley.

- If you all like Thai food Sawadee (http://www.sawadee1.com/) on South Temple is really good.

- Don't forget the Red Iguana :slightly_smiling_face:
- Finally, SOMI Vietnamese Bistro (http://somislc.com/) is really good and the owners are super nice.
